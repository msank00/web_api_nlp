# :rocket: Document similarity measurement and web api

- This simple project creates Document Similarity Score (using `tfidf`) and exposes them as a simple flask api with a minimal bootstrap framework.
- The bigger goal is to re-use this web framework to showcase any other NLP task
- In future, this project can be containerized into Docker very easily and can be deployed in Heroku as a fun exercise.     

## Start server

From the parent directory run `python app.py` and open [http://0.0.0.0:5002/](http://0.0.0.0:5002/)

The final output will look something like this:
